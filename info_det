INFO IN DETAIL

Python notebooks to quickly code real time with bdp bdh bds, Excel function builder quickly helps find fields
Excel Add-in for BQL practice.
Use Excel addin for bql optimizations and less data usage .- can always upload Excel spreadsheets with vba macros 
** Practice with flds and args -> will allow which formulas (bdp/h/s) use which fields (yield/yas/...) 

Regular outputing .py files -> figure out how to output to either command prompt or some anaconda app (temporarily) or HTML/web based page (long term)
Automate several steps from Jupiter notebook -> steady work in revisit-blp
Eg pairs trading across several ideas, find alpha over time - figure out a permanent mkt ID use (BB UNIQ more mid office/GIDP, ISIN prob)

Stack overflow participation - continue to scour for xbbg examples

Think in SQL - views, stored procedures, joins/unions, where/groupbys
How to query in order to make superiors lives easier
Mimic Richard Griffith, avik Mukherjee
Practice in SQL mgt studio- against SM view , against STT SDO data -> try to imitate a RUNBK check to validate your code!, make sure the result is very close to expectation

DAPI Constructing Formulas/Troubleshooting Help - keep reading thoroughly! (important)
