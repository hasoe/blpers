====== BBG ======

Python notebooks to quickly code real time with bdp bdh bds, Excel function builder quickly helps find fields
Excel Add-in for BQL practice.
Use Excel addin for bql optimizations and less data usage .- can always upload Excel spreadsheets with vba macros 
** Practice with flds and args -> will allow which formulas (bdp/h/s) use which fields (yield/yas/...) 


DAPI Constructing Formulas/Troubleshooting Help - keep reading thoroughly! (important)
* Remember Hidden Sheets and Named Formulas (NameManager) in BBG Excel Add-ins


Regular outputing .py files -> figure out how to output to either command prompt or some anaconda app (temporarily) or HTML/web based page (long term)
Automate several steps from Jupiter notebook -> steady work in revisit-blp
Eg pairs trading across several ideas, find alpha over time - figure out a permanent mkt ID use (use ISIN as default)


====== COMMUNITY ======

Stack overflow participation - continue to scour for xbbg examples


====== AGI ======
Think in SQL (+BQL) - SELECT FROM WHERE - views, stored procedures, joins, unions, where/filtering, grouping, sorting, table+scalar valued funcs - in order to imitate main Excel operations
** How to query in order to make superiors lives easier
** Review in Sharepoint Deep Dive Sessions
* Practice in SQL mgt studio- against SM view , against STT SDO data -> try to imitate a RUNBK check to validate your code!, make sure the result is very close to expectation
