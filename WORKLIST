====== BBG ======

Python notebooks to quickly code real time with bdp bdh bds, Excel function builder quickly helps find fields
Excel Add-in for BQL practice.
Use Excel addin for bql optimizations and less data usage .- can always upload Excel spreadsheets with vba macros 
** Practice with flds and args -> will allow which formulas (bdp/h/s) use which fields (yield/yas/...) 


DAPI Constructing Formulas/Troubleshooting Help - keep reading thoroughly! (important)
* Remember Hidden Sheets and Named Formulas (NameManager) in BBG Excel Add-ins


Regular outputing .py files -> figure out how to output to either command prompt or some anaconda app (temporarily) or HTML/web based page (long term)
Automate several steps from Jupiter notebook -> steady work in revisit-blp
Eg pairs trading across several ideas, find alpha over time - figure out a permanent mkt ID use (use ISIN as default)


====== COMMUNITY ======

Stack overflow participation - continue to scour for xbbg examples


====== AGI ======
Think in SQL (+BQL) - SELECT FROM WHERE - views, stored procedures, joins, unions, where/filtering, grouping, sorting, table+scalar valued funcs - in order to imitate main Excel operations
** How to query in order to make superiors lives easier
** Review in Sharepoint Deep Dive Sessions
* Practice in SQL mgt studio- against SM view , against STT SDO data -> try to imitate a RUNBK check to validate your code!, make sure the result is very close to expectation

Hi Wiwi,

Thank you very much for your candid reply; it was very helpful and I highly appreciate the feedback. I was able to apply for the job listing initially via LinkedIn as you recommended with my updated CV.

I agree that because an international posting carries with it a certain level of commitment, I would want to be very intentional from my end about my career strategy. I do believe in the goals and remit of our EDM department, and it is my hope in due course to learn, develop, and network with many talented colleagues across the company in Frankfurt. As you alluded, the department has strategic backing from above and is growing as seen on the job board as well and I feel quite encouraged.

(To be fair, I am so far not complaining earning in US Dollars at the moment! ðŸ˜Š)
