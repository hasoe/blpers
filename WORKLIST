====== BBG ======

Python notebooks to quickly code real time with bdp bdh bds, Excel function builder quickly helps find fields
Excel Add-in for BQL practice.
Use Excel addin for bql optimizations and less data usage .- can always upload Excel spreadsheets with vba macros 
** Practice with flds and args -> will allow which formulas (bdp/h/s) use which fields (yield/yas/...) 


DAPI Constructing Formulas/Troubleshooting Help - keep reading thoroughly! (important)
* Remember Hidden Sheets and Named Formulas (NameManager) in BBG Excel Add-ins


Regular outputing .py files -> figure out how to output to either command prompt or some anaconda app (temporarily) or HTML/web based page (long term)
Automate several steps from Jupiter notebook -> steady work in revisit-blp
Eg pairs trading across several ideas, find alpha over time - figure out a permanent mkt ID use (use ISIN as default)


====== COMMUNITY ======

Stack overflow participation - continue to scour for xbbg examples


====== AGI ======
Think in SQL (+BQL) - SELECT FROM WHERE - views, stored procedures, joins, unions, where/filtering, grouping, sorting, table+scalar valued funcs - in order to imitate main Excel operations
** How to query in order to make superiors lives easier
** Review in Sharepoint Deep Dive Sessions
* Practice in SQL mgt studio- against SM view , against STT SDO data -> try to imitate a RUNBK check to validate your code!, make sure the result is very close to expectation

Wiwi Email - Job posting 
Hi Wiwi,

Thank you for sharing the below. I had originally given Caroline a quick news update over text – about the Structured Alpha resolution, available options for me going forward (eg. relocation), and am appreciative of her efforts to reach out to you on my behalf. 

Charlotte has also shared with me the Frankfurt Data Analyst job posting on Tuesday, so thank you very much to you and her in helping to proceed (by the way, I was curious and tried clicking “Apply Now” on the job board, but while the system was able to authenticate me, the next page fails to load after trying to “Apply”).

Regarding the “concern”, I had only mentioned (to both Caroline and Charlotte) that it would be ideal for me to have some clarity sooner rather than later given the increasingly uncertain macroeconomic environment with regards to job security and job contracts. I am also flexible and attuned to the firm’s business and staffing needs, especially with regard to the timing.

I am of course still interested in the Frankfurt opportunity, and have been doing some due diligence on what this international assignment might and will entail. It is an exciting prospect that also carries with it some anxiety surrounding this job process. It is my hope we can keep the lines of communication open as the process moves forward.
 
On a separate note, I would like to also ask for your permission in potentially requesting a working from abroad (UK) later this year in December. I can follow up on this topic in a separate email.

Many thanks and best regards,
