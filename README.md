# blpers - Bloomberg API - personal work

Jupyter notebook - Level 2 (ETA:1w) in personal software development cycle. Used after initial due diligence in Level 0 (Bloomberg UI ~ ETA:15m), and exploratory spreadsheet analysis in Level 1 (BQL / VBA ~ ETA:1d). Initially mainly used with xbbg Bloomberg API Python library.

TO-DO - Try to Normalize (z-scoring) when useful and appropriate (using a historical data set 1-3y as sample) -> see ZH/JPM Zoltan
Create a basic L/S Model (Single-Name v Index) - 
  a- eg TSLA v NDX100
     eg TGT v SPX500
     eg Value v Growth
     eg US v EU
     eg 
  b- Measure company alpha v 1y/5y, normalized by beta divisor
  
Create a customized macro analysis framework (basic: Rates v Spreads v Indices / intermediate: Non-linear insights w/ Options?)  
  a- eg UST 10Y v FNCL v SPX (GOVT v MTGE v EQ)
  b- eg UST 2Y v 10Y v CDX IG v CDX HY (Curve Structure & Spreads)
  c- eg SPX v VIX (Volatility / Greeks)
  d- eg FX Fwd/Swaps v OIS-implied rates
  e- eg

Must continue SQL learning @ AGI ("Dirty Work")
  a- Practice thinking in Query (also: BQL) - Join/Filter & Sort & Grouping - SELECT FROM WHERE - in order to imitate main Excel operations
  b- Understand the critical Tables, Views, Stored Procedures within AGI GIDP - use current BAU / Runbook topics to explore the use-cases
    i- Stored Procs offer rea
